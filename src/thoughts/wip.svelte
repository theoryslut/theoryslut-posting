<h3>what im workin on</h3>
<p>
	Soo I've been WORKING on several essays that have yet to congeal into postable posts. While I
	generally don't want to let perfect be the enemy of good, they're longerform stuff I'd rather
	spend time and attn with vs posting half-assed versions of just to post.
</p>
<p>
	but in the meantime, my writing block has let up for the first time in years and i'm feeling an
	itch to put shit out into the world. so! here's a short list of what i've been reading and
	thinking with.
</p>
<h4>moral panics</h4>
<h5>mastercard vs imgur porn</h5>
<p>
	i decided i was dumb to have kinda ignored porn and sw more broadly in my mastodon post the day
	imgur announced it was banning nsfw pics lol. evidently this is due to some mastercard regulations
	that are being enforced at the behest of the same evangelical fash group exodus cry, previously
	ihop (lol), behind a ton of nefarious stuff globally. ive got a post in the works thinking through
	the imgur stuff, but it surprised me that the fact a bitch cant search for noncon porn anymore
	dates back specifically to the april 2021 new mastercard regulations. not even law! mastercard is
	now kinkshaming me directly! ohh noo, mastercard...my free access to kinky vintage porn...nooo
	dont take it away....id do Anything...yes, anything.....
</p>
<h5>amy de'ath, max fox, and rahul rao - sex panics, capitalism, and the global right</h5>
<p>
	i went to a talk hosted by, incredibly, an org fashioning itself <b>Historical Materialism</b> on Tues,
	and i am BUZZING. do not want to summarize the takeaways because i'd likely butcher them tbh but i
	was really invigorated by the talks and their helpfully very well flagged interlocutors. on my reading
	list now are, among other things,
</p>
<h5>moishe postone - anti-semitism and national socialism</h5>
<p>
	finished this one immediately and was like Fuck damn this feels both very helpful and
	frighteningly relevant. i don't think i can summarize this one helpfully to be honest with you, i
	think i'd make some critical vocabulary errors trying. definitely worth the read, with the caveat
	that it's pretty marxist in terminology and can't really be translated outside those terms IMO
	(thus me not making the attempt). making me want to read <i>time, labor, and social domination</i
	>, postone's opus.
</p>
<h5>endnotes - the logic of gender</h5>
<p>
	speaking of marxist jargon. . . i'm halfway thru this but would not have even started if not for
	max fox's shoutout because hot damn this is theoretically dense. it's got that classic marxist
	text energy where i alternate between saying to myself "damn why didn't i think of that, that DOES
	follow straight from capital" and "damn i will never be smart enough in marx to fully understand
	any of this." a girl can dream
</p>
<h5>stuart hall et al - policing the crisis: mugging, the state, and law and order</h5>
<p>
	this seems to be another touch point, similar to postone's essay, for marxist takes on moral
	panics. not sure i have the bandwidth at the moment, but on the list for when i do.
</p>
<h4>techie stuff</h4>
<h5>raytracing in one weekend + real time rendering</h5>
<p>
	my atypically apolitical interest of the moment is graphics programming lol. i'm working through
	the book real time rendering w some friends from recurse. most of it is going over my head but
	that's fine, it's a Tome! the next few chapters are on physical rendering / ray tracing, so i
	wanna work through some ray tracing exercises so i know like, what that is how it works. will say
	optics was not my strong suit in physics but that's okay we'll manage!
</p>
<h5>tech learning collective, over the wire</h5>
<p>
	someone linked some anarchist techie collective notes in a chat im in recently, one hyperlink led
	to another and i spent a bit of time reading heartbreakingly naiive technoanarchist takes on what
	"we" should "do" to "manifest" the "dream" of the "internet". im more of a luddite myself
	philosophically, but one take i <i>did</i> find interesting was that we need less programmers and more
	sysadmins if we're gonna be able to use tech for anticapitalist causes effectively. this is a somewhat
	intuitive thing considering many programmers learned it for work ("to build more exploitative apps"
	generally) and almost all "learn to code" programs are focused on job-readiness. versus, it's sysadmin
	and more fundamental knowledge-of-how-to-tape-things-together skills that would be needed to un-cloud-ify
	and de-monopolize web hosting, and on a broader scale to dream up more promising ways of interacting
	and organizing digitally.
</p>
<p>
	i generally enjoy becoming more fluent on the cli, so i think i'll keep hacking away at over the
	wire challenges when i have the time in between all my other hobbies lol. there's also the tech
	learning collective, but aside from their free content they seem to mostly be on hiatus in terms
	of hosting events.
</p>
<p>
	tbh would love a pal in this endeavor, im a social learner. hit da email address below if you are
	also a baby protocol nerd +/ amateur sysadmin and wanna learn together.
</p>
<h4>a brief syllabus on the archive, psychoanalysis, and the desire for history</h4>
<p>so in the middle of dicsussing the sections of</p>
<h5>christopher chitty - sexual hegemony</h5>
<p>about homosexuality and the desire for history, i reread</p>
<h5>carolyn steedman - dust</h5>
<p>
	a book which which is in part about historicizing the desire for history, which led to me
	remembering it heavily cites
</p>
<h5>jacques derrida - archive fever</h5>
<p>which turns out to be a book which takes</p>
<h5>yosef hayim yerushalmi - freud's moses: judaism terminable and interminable</h5>
<p>
	as its primary subject. yerushalmi turns out to have another book that gets brought up somewhat
	surprisingly in <i>neither</i> archive fever, nor dust, that is
</p>
<h5>yosef hayim yerushalmi - zakhor</h5>
<p>
	which is an extended examination of the desire for history (or often, absolute lack thereof)
	throughout rabbinic judaism's history.
</p>
<p>
	in thinking aloud to myself as to why neither dust (about the desire for history) nor archive
	fever (about many things because this is derrida lmao, but partially about the psychoanalytic
	desire for history/archive, which is for yerushalmi jewish in content) cite zakhor, and being
	reminded of the rather poorly-aged sections of totem & taboo, i remembered that carolyn steedman
	wrote another banger of a book before dust,
</p>
<h5>carolyn steedman - strange dislocations</h5>
<p>
	which is a book i've only read sections of but really enjoyed, and which is about (to quote the
	blurb) "how the individual and personal history that a child embodied came to represent human
	'insideness'" and "the part that Freudian psychoanalysis played, between 1900 and 1920, in
	summarizing and reformulating the Victorian idea that the core of an individualâ€™s psychic identity
	was his or her own lost past, or childhood." which just seems overwhelmingly in conversation with
	many of the above texts. which is also interesting, considering that dust itself almost entirely
	neglects to talk about psychoanalysis (and thus freud's moses and the middle sections of archive
	fever, except in passing) and the psychoanalytic account of history. why? since carolyn steedman
	literally wrote a book on that subject?
</p>
<h5>so</h5>
<p>
	i've got myself a little constellation of texts-in-conversation, and while I have yet to reread
	archive fever and strange dislocations, i'm very much looking to put these texts together in an
	interesting way in the near future. stay tuned!
</p>
