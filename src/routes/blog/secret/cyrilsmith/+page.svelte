<h1>On: Hegel, Marx and the Enlightenment: an Interim Report (an interim report)</h1>
<h2>10 August 2023</h2>
<h4>WIP! If you've ended up here and your name isn't Steph, something has gone horribly wrong!</h4>
<p>
	so, i was reading latour's <i>we have never been modern,</i> and he brought up "marx and the twin
	enlightenments," and i didn't know tf he was talking about, and googled, and ended up on a piece
	by a Cyril Smith hosted at marxists.org (where else) which had some <b>very</b> interesting stuff
	about Hegel's idiosyncratic Christianity, and also a bunch of stuff I think is quite wrong.
	funnily enough, i think i know <i>exactly</i> what latour meant by the phrase marx and the twin enlightenments
	now. this essay was originally a text to a friend trying to explain my Issues w smith that has ballooned
	wildly out of scope. enjoy!
</p>
<h3>the stakes</h3>

<RainbowLink
	href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-cyril/works/articles/interim.htm"
	>Here's the essay in question.</RainbowLink
>
<p>
	<b>TL;DR</b> Cyril Smith is arguing vanguardism and scientific rationalist socialism as represented
	by most of the socialist revolutions of the 20th century profoundly misunderstands Marx; as a result
	of not being able to comprehend or integrate marx's engagement with Hegel; due to the profundity and
	centrality of the sorta pan-Abrahamic but also just Christian mysticism (we'll get there dw) within
	Hegel's philosophic work; mysticism that secularist socialist rationalists were fully unable to comprehend
	let alone integrate.
</p>
<p>
	what i am wanting to get at here is how cyril smith's framing of his recovery of
	religious/spiritual/"mystical" elements in Hegel, and his clarification of Marx's criticism of
	religion, are part of a larger tradition of marxist humanism that's arguably incoherent outside of
	a modernist Western European Christian frame of reference.
</p>
<p>
	my actual argument is tbh p concise. in both (some forms of) christianity and (some forms of)
	marxism, entire but externally-coherent worldviews get taken up only so much as they fit a
	pre-determined mold. whether the mold is "how does this content prophecy the (second) coming of
	the Messiah, Jesus Christ" (some Christianities) or "how does this content prophecy the eventual
	triumph of humanity over the tragedy of nature-history-economics-civilization" (some Marxisms),
	the rhetorical move is essentially the same. and more than that, these molds are in the <i>same</i
	>
	tradition: enlightenment universalisms that really struggle to account for plurality and decentralized
	culture meaningfully. it is this exact messianic universalism that smith is actually recovering between
	hegel and marx.
</p>
<CenterImage
	src={hasbeen}
	alt="the astronaut 'always has been' meme where one astronaut looks at the globe and another astronaut holds a gun to their head. first text 'wait it's all messianism' second text 'always has been'"
/>
<p>
	this universalism is so complete/total it is paradigmatically not understood as such within the
	tradition. because universalism posits no "outside", concepts which <i>are</i> "outside" can exist
	only insofar as they can be <i>incorporated</i> into the pre-existent universe. some real "if i choose
	not to see it, it doesn't exist" shit.
</p>
<p>
	cyril smith ends the piece with a particularly lovely section of marx that he argues preserves
	Marx's engagements with both Feuerbach and Hegel. smith argues convincingly that, read in context
	of the development of german idealism, marx's own writings stand firmly against vanguardism. for
	marx, <b>
		"[the human] acts upon external nature and changes it, and in this way he simultaneously changes
		his own nature,"</b
	> aka, societal change and personal change are mutually constitutive and not a process which can be
	directed from above or outside.
</p>
<p>
	i really like this conclusion and think it's really correct! but i think where marx lands is
	precisely in the location shown in the above quote: with the figure of the Human, at his work.
	there's a deep commitment within marx's writings to a universalist, humanist project that Smith is
	really invested in preserving. because of that commitment perhaps, he is not as attentive to the
	ways in which "the human" becomes "the european christian, secularized" within the larger context
	of german idealism and marxism. this version of marxist humanism struggles to fully apprehend the
	existence of what are famously termed 'internal divisions,' and especially insofar as those
	"divisions" might shift the content of what is already-assumed to be the universalized human at
	work. i don't like the term 'internal divisions' in this context; the term itself preserves the
	belief that these divisions are experienced internal to an already-encompassing whole. they might
	more helpfully be termed heterogeneity or variation, in a less necessarily h/Human-specific sense.
</p>
<p>
	OFC instead of leaving it there i'm gonna be explicit about it lol. to get more granular with how
	i'm seeing this all crop up in Smith and why it's frustrating, let's get specific. I wanna dig
	into the claim that Hegel's religious attidude, which Marx keeps while dropping the explicitly
	religious aspect, was both 1. supposedly post- or anti-Enlightenment and supposedly 2.
	pan-Abrahamic or influenced by Judaism/Islam. I'll tie it up with some Latour to bring it full
	circle. Let's get into the second claim first.
</p>
<h3>pt 1: christian takes on kabbalah: or, boehme as an #inclusivity queen</h3>
<h5>
	most of the framing/info in this section is sourced from <RainbowLink
		href="https://ezrarose.itch.io/fyma-a-lesser-key"
		>this zine by ezra rose. it's very good! give it a look if you're interested</RainbowLink
	>
</h5>
<h4>background</h4>
<p>
	first, a brief but important aside into history of Christian "uptake" of Jewish "mysticism" since
	I know shit all about Islam.
</p>
<p>
	Early kabbalah (an ongoing tradition within judaism) gets discovered really early on by christians
	looking to convert jews. like, 13th century early. this one <RainbowLink
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Kabbalah#Raymond_Llull">guy</RainbowLink
	> who knows hebrew<SuperScript id="rare" /> reads it and decides it's all about christianity, actually,
	and that it's the perfect tool with which to convince jews to convert to xianity.
</p>
<p>
	malformed kabbalah and other misunderstandings of jewish tradition get picked up big time from the
	time of the crusades/reconquista through the renaissance. the stereotype of jews as very powerful
	sorcerers both falls into earlier Hellenistic imagery<SuperScript id="josephus" /> and helps to extend
	and intensify the violent christian doctrines of the time. the doctrine of supercessionism, combined
	with the borrowed stereotypes of powerful sorcery, combined with blood libel and other antisemitic
	myths that really start intensifying with the crusades, combine to form an image of Jewish tradition
	and Jewish people as magical, powerful, mystical, corruptive, seductive, and above all dangerous. does
	this sound familiar? perhaps like. . . orientalist? maybe? yeah.
</p>
<p>
	So there's this assumption that anything Jewish, /especially/ mystic or (folk) magically oriented
	stuff, must be both 1. Incredibly powerful magic and 2. hold some sort of "secret" to christian
	tradition that christian tradition itself hasn't preserved (a conception that really lives to this
	day). and if it has truth about xianity, clearly the jews KNOW jesus is the messiah and are just
	choosing out of pure evil to refuse to recognize him and instead do all this powerful child eating
	black magic. really some classic stuff.
</p>
<p>
	So! this myth (with roots in hellenistic times) ends up proliferating all these "grimoires" that
	start getting put out supposedly by solomon but really by whomever (in arabic/greek, later latin)
	all through the middle ages. from the late middle ages / early renaissance, they take a decidedly
	darker and more "demonic" turn (coinciding with increased persecutions & expulsions of jews).
	these later grimoires are clearly made by christians, they have like random hebrew words, some
	made up -- the equivalent of contemporary chinese character tattoos on americans that say "hope"
	but really say "toilet" or whatever. And looking at these texts through a modern historical lense,
	it's obvious that 1. religious elites are the only ones literate enough to be making these at the
	time and 2. no actual jewish person made any of this shit bc it's got like, crosses and fake
	hebrew characters and it spells the name of gd wrong? But at the time, xians thought of them as
	authentically jewish, partially due to prosecution/legal history (what else). The catholic church
	is obviously not jazzed about its monks doing magic spells for money or summoning demons or
	whatever, so when the monks get caught they blame the production of these books on jews, which is
	convenient for them and also for the catholic church's view of who is responsible for
	evil/heresy/magic at the time and who they're willing to do a pogrom on. it's all quite
	convenient.
</p>
<p>
	so. the specific tradition of like, grimoire shit and appropriated kabbalah getting attributed to
	jewish people when really it's made by and for christians to be edgy or convert jews goes from
	13th century to present fucking day cyril smith. it's the history of "the antisemitic conspiracy
	theory" as much as it is tied up in much of christian mystic symbolism since the crusades. because
	much supposedly-secular antisemitism is still taking a lot from the antisemitism of christian
	europe, and because antisemitism among other xenophobias is a really crucial tool in building
	supposedly coherent "secular"/Christian nationalisms in europe.
</p>
<p>
	it's this particular symbolism-- the shit lifted from kabbalah that becomes distinctly christian
	while retaining to present day the common understanding of it actually being jewish, and therefore
	possessing a secret potentially evil power christian society could never produce -- that cyril
	smith is referencing as the "symbols and ideas" from hermetic xianity that get preserved through
	to rosicrucianism and freemasonry and shit.
</p>
<p>let's move on to what Smith is actually saying, now that we've covered the context.</p>
<h4>boehme & the rosicrucians</h4>
<p>
	We can start where Smith does: with the Lutheran mystic philosopher Boehme's influence on Hegel.
</p>
<blockquote>
	Many of Boehme’s notions, often expressed with great obscurity, were linked with the Jewish
	mystical tradition called the Cabbalah, as well as with the Islamic movement, Sufism. All three,
	Christian, Jewish and Islamic heresies, maintained a centuries-long collaboration and dispute.
</blockquote>
<p>
	So we've established that the "collaboration" is a fairly one-way street with not a lot of
	communication versus straight up theft and projection between Christianity and Judaism at this
	point in history. Idk as much about the other two legs of the triangle, so let's do some
	spitballing. It's my understanding that jewish ppl were much more integrated w muslims socially in
	islamic-ruled areas so potentially more collaboration happened there as opposed to christian
	europe, but Jewish-Muslim relations are mildly out of scope when discussing Boehme and Hegel
	(christians the both). So, onto Christian-Muslim "collaboration."
</p>
<p>
	i'd be pretty surprised if the catholics were in "collaboration" with islamic scholars on
	mysticisms at this point. rather than like, looting their libraries in the crusades and then
	translating all the arabic to latin. this is not a thoroughly researched line of my thought to be
	clear. but a quick dive into hermeticism wikipedia shows that <RainbowLink
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_translations_of_the_12th_century"
		>as i kinda expected,</RainbowLink
	>
	a lot of the texts that become central to hermeticism are first translated into latin from greek &
	arabic due to the conquest of muslim spain in the 11th century. which. yeah.<SuperScript
		id="hermeticism"
	/>
</p>

<h5>boehme</h5>
<p>
	<strike>i TBH have no clue about Jakob Boehme in particular.</strike>
	ok actually i did a bit of a deep dive. boehme did not know latin let alone hebrew! so any of his "kabbalah"
	knowledge was coming through three levels of translation (hebrew > latin > german, spoken probably
	mostly considering the lack of available written translations at the time). he seems to have gotten
	most of his knowledge of kabbalah from this one silesian guy, Balthazar Walter, who was a big fan.
	walter also probably did not know hebrew or arabic lol. here's some of what we have on their collaboration
	from a primary source:<SuperScript id="walter" />
</p>
<CenterImage
	src={boehme}
	alt="Of those learn’d men that convers’d with [Böhme] in the greatest
		familiarity, was one Balthazar Walter, this Gentelman was a Silesian
		by birth, by profession a Physician, and had in the search of the an-

		and the Araby’s, and there found such small remainders of it, that he

/>
<p>
	pretty fucking funny that this guy tried to invent modern orientalism ~3 centuries early but
	didn't actually like "the orient" enough to succeed and instead got back into protestantism. extra
	funny that this seems to be boehme's main source of information on islamic and jewish texts and
	traditions.<SuperScript id="6years" /> SUPREMELY funny that he was probably inspired to take this journey
	by the tales of the journeys of the legendary and probably <b>fictional!</b> founder of
	rosicrucianism, Christian Rosenkreuz, who supposedly visited the "Orient" and similarly decided
	Christianity fucked a lot harder (according to some monks who <RainbowLink
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama_Fraternitatis#Origin">wrote a novel</RainbowLink
	> about him in ~1610).
</p>

<p>yeah.</p>

<p>
	smith's framing of this history as "christian theosophy is in collaboration with jewish kabbalah
	and islamic sufism" is really misleading IMO. "in collaboration" assumes it was taking actual
	concepts from an existent tradition and shifting them or reworking them within another tradition
	(which is literally what all tradition/culture is!). this, IMO, is not really that? it's more
	taking another tradition's objects and deciding they have magical powers because racism, and
	maintaining that sense of distance and orientalist structure of desire to those objects in order
	to continue their sense of power.
</p>

<h3>
	pt 2: on the supposed radical difference of Hegel's value in christianity, and its (lack of)
	pan-Abrahamic content
</h3>

<p>
	Smith is trying to show that the classic framing of the socialist project as one to "overcome the
	lunacy of modern society by rationally rearranging the social-economic connections between
	‘citizens’" from the top down misunderstands hegel and marx's commitments or lack thereof to
	non-empiricist rationalism and atheism. I'm with him there.
</p>
<p>Smith makes two moves that I can't follow him to, however.</p>
<p>
	<b>First</b>, he paints a scene that Hegel is genuinely drawing from a universalist religious
	fabric woven from threads from the major Abrahamic religions (and thus, kinda all civilizational
	religion, and therefore kinda all religion, in that really classic and deeply racist way). I think
	I've shown above that the religious ideas Hegel was working with were deeply and profoundly
	Christian, and their citations of other traditions appeared firmly within the scope of Christian
	interpretation and not any real engagements with Jewish or Islamic tradition on their own terms.
</p>
<p>
	This universalizing-subsuming tendency, where other traditions are taken up only to reinforce
	Christian philosophic tradition and usually completely contrary to their original meanings, is so
	central to Western European philosophy that even when the Christianity disappears, the subsumption
	stays. When we look at this 'universalism' on these terms rather than its own, it's clear what we
	have is not a complete universe but rather a singular tradition that is continuously unable to
	converse meaningfully outside itselt. if the spiritual "unity" Smith is finding in Hegel and then
	Marx is just christianity by a gdless name, that's already a nonstarter for any "universal"
	project.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Second</b>, he makes the claim that Hegel's Christianity
</p>
<ol>
	<li>is part of a long, persecuted, underground, hidden Christian mystic tradition;</li>
	<li>a tradition that got buried and covered up in the Enlightenment rationalist movement;</li>
	<li>which Hegel recovered and restored to centrality;</li>
	<li>which Marx took up but removed the religion from;</li>
	<li>
		and which 20th cent socialists, returning to the Enlightenment rationalism that Marx had left
		behind, are unable to account for or integrate into their marxisms.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	My project in this next section is to show that this history is stunningly inaccurate. Let's go
	transition-by-transition.
</p>

<h4>1. & 2. "break" between a persecuted hermeticism/mysticism and the enlightenment</h4>
<p>
	Smith seems to think that the Enlightenment was a "break" with the past of hermeticism and
	christian mysticism:
</p>
<blockquote>
	During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Enlightenment, denouncing such notions as superstitious
	nonsense, swept them aside or forced them underground.
</blockquote>
<p>
	This simply doesn't follow. The Renaissance saw an absolute <i>explosion</i> in interest in
	ancient texts including/especially supposedly "spiritual" texts; it was responsible for another
	huge wave of interest in both Kabbalah and the previously-untranslated sections of the Hermetica
	that Smith himself mentions above, not to mention a completely unprecedented explosion of
	christian engagement with hebrew texts when all the protestant schisms wanted their own
	translations in their vernaculars. "Forced underground" is also really rich considering the
	centrality and power of the people who were responsible for what we now consider the classic works
	of the Enlightenment. Persecuted or excommunicated perhaps, but "underground?" It was the
	<i>reactionary forces</i> of mostly the Church (and thus State) persecuting these fuckers, not their
	fellow rationalizers and reformers! I'll let him finish his thought here:
</p>
<blockquote>
	But they did not entirely disappear. Not only did Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry preserve some of
	their symbols, but Hermetic ideas as a whole remained current. Their adherents included people
	like Fichte, Schelling, Goethe, Shelley and Blake. In the twentieth century, trends as diverse as
	WB Yeats, Surrealism and Jungian psycho-analysis have drawn on them with enthusiasm.
</blockquote>
<p>
	Cool haha. So like, first of all the concept that it's like, The Enlightenment Rationalists Versus
	The Free Masons and Rosicrucians is like, what history books are you even Reading My Dude, how the
	Fuck is the history of christian secret societies in Europe not simply the history of the
	enlightenment and the development of "secularism" by another name, they were often literally the
	same people. also, though freemasons weren't <i>explicitly</i> christian for all of their history,
	they incorporated members of other faiths <RainbowLink
		href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/freemasons">(judaism i think mainly)</RainbowLink
	> only insofar as those members were a part of the ostensibly secularized but contentfully christian
	humanist tradition they developed as a collective. other secret societies in particularly
	<RainbowLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonari">italy</RainbowLink> have christian and
	nationalist histories that similarly cannot be accounted for outside the context of the enlightenment
	and the development of the (christian, european) nationstate.
</p>
<p>
	To tie it back to the previous section, I think positioning Hermetic "symbols" and "ideas" as
	like, a persecuted pan-Abrahamic tradition that survives on the margins to finally triumph in
	Hegelian Marxist Humanism, rather than a deeply native strain of mildly to insanely racist
	Christian European cultural production, is a truly astounding formulation. the concept that this
	religious content has been in some way "hidden" in the history of xianity/the enlightenment/"the
	ancient past" but hegel was the one to bring it out (for the right reader who knows to look for
	the signs) is a mischaracterization of how influential this shit was and is to the western
	tradition. like, the article on walther balthazar i read for this piece was literally talking
	about how it's impossible to know if someone was actually into hermeticism by whether they owned
	dozens of hermetic grimoires because they were SO popular and so many people just had them like
	lying about. the equivalent of today's coffee table art books.
</p>
<p>
	western occultism is not some persecuted ethnic tradition. it's like the british schoolboy
	homosexuality of its context in terms of relationship to and subversion-through-reinforcement of
	power and hegemony. things can be both heresies to the catholic church AND relatively powerful,
	simultaneously. famously the catholic church! did not win the historical battle to continue its
	stranglehold on western european christian orthodoxy! it lost! to the liberal protestant
	rationalists and orientalists and arguably, if you really want to call yourself a marxist, due to
	capitalism! anyway
</p>
<h4>2. & 3. "break" between christianity/belief in the christian gd and the enlightenment</h4>

<p>
	I understand that Hegel was intervening in an earlier strain of Enlightenment philosophy.<SuperScript
		id="which"
	/> But I've got major beef with Smith over the contents of that intervention. Hegel's intervention
	into philosophy had little to do with recovering the "gd" or "religious content" from a rationalist-secular-empiricist
	tradition, and much more to do with making interventions within that same christian philosophic tradition.
	Painting it as the former is essentially projecting secular Marxist modernist worldviews onto the largely
	self-professed Christians of two to four centuries earlier.
</p>
<p>
	The first problem with Smith's argument arises because the rationalist schools and the empirical
	schools -- collapsed into "rationalist science" in Smith's piece -- were <i
		>famously at odds with each other</i
	> during the early Enlightenment, not one coherent strain. They had major disagreements on whether
	truth came from 1. networks of witnesses to reproducible experiments on external non-human objects
	(empiricism), or 2. from rational human thought about the fundamental symbolic truths of the world
	(as expressed in philosophy and mathematics). this disagreement had profound implications for the basis
	of state-religious authority. neither of the schools would have been able to understand their arguments
	as secular projects relating to a gdless or non-christian or liberal pluralist society. these disagreements
	also persist, and their fundamental inability to reconcile form the mutually-incoherent basis of the
	"modern" world. More on this later
</p>
<p>
	Second of all, the supposed "secularism" of the Enlightenment was the development of liberal
	political-economic tolerance for religious difference through a deeply and self-consciously if
	non-orthodoxically Christian framework (a la Locke), not an areligious atheism. Full
	secularization in the sense that Smith is referring to -- atheism, lack of connection to extant
	cultural-religious tradition, disdain of "superstition", devout faith to the modern conceptions of
	"science" and "history" --- could not have happened at a time when Church and State and elite
	knowledge production were nearly one and the same project and nearly all humans in european
	society were in some way religiously affiliated and/or bound in traditional feudal relationships.
	projecting the modern sense of secularism, that is to say scientist atheism combined with
	assimilation into western-european-christian-capitalist culture, onto what were at the time new or
	non-orthodox ways of doing Christianity is mindbogglingly anachronistic. it would require the
	forces of the bourgeois nationalist revolutions of the 19th century and the forces of
	industrialization (arguably the same force) to develop the sort of disdain for and identification
	of "superstition" and "religion" (not to mention entire cultures and races) as ascientific and
	antiphilosophical in the way Smith is referencing.
</p>
<p>
	Take or leave my analysis of the development of secularism, let's go down the list since other
	than Kant, Smith doesn't really name names. Descartes had theological Christian writings; Hobbes
	had theological Christian writings; Spinoza famously focused on theological questions from both
	Christian and Jewish (for once, actually) orientations;<SuperScript id="spinoza" /> Leibniz focused
	extensively on Gd in his metaphysical texts; Rosseau was a Calvinist who converted to Roman Catholicism
	and then went back to Calvinism, who (as his affiliations would indicate) believed in the necessity
	of formal religion even as he critiqued the present manifestation; even <RainbowLink
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant#Religious_writings">Kant himself</RainbowLink
	> was understood at the time as having promulgated a <i>defense</i>
	of Christianity in his <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>. WHO are these secularists?
</p>
<p>
	After digging around a bit and in the interest of being mildly more generous to Smith, I think it
	is probably Kant and Kant alone whom Smith is referring to wrt the disregard for "superstition"
	and "religion." I have no interest in going and reading up on Kant lol so this is a
	<RainbowLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant#Religious_writings"
		>wikipedia level analysis</RainbowLink
	> but it seems the dude was targeting "external ritual, superstition, and a hierarchical church order",
	what he sees as "a religion of counterfeit service to God" in COPR. It looks like Kant's actual personal
	theology is up for debate, but he certainly <i>had</i> a theology, and his arguments were largely
	understood at the time (before industrial, modernizing secularization) as having great relevance
	to Christian theology. I am actually pretty sure Smith is talking specifically about Kant when he
	talks about "Enlightenment rationalism" because <i>Smith himself</i> seems to have a rather Kantian
	perspective on religion. I'd like to take a sec do a read on Smith here:
</p>
<blockquote>
	In the orthodox versions of the three big Western religions, Almighty God, (who was, naturally,
	bound up with the almighty powers on Earth), produced the whole show and wrote the script. If you
	complained about how dreadful it was, you were fobbed off with a story about free will; this was
	God’s alibi, a clever trick by the Divinity to put all the blame on us mortals. (12) Orthodoxy
	like this leaves no space for human freedom, for subjective activity: the Almighty has the whole
	thing sown up.
</blockquote>
<p>
	so this is an embarrassing and IMO pretty offensive gloss. in this section smith, in addition to
	reducing all the various sects and branches of Abrahamic religions and theology down to
	essentially Lutheranism/Calvinism, shows a real inability to take religious thought and experience
	seriously on their own terms. Smith does a great job with Hegel's Christianity and ~ambiguous
	mysticisms~, but can't handle respect when it comes to anything <i>other</i> than a Kantian gd-without-religion-itself
	style Christianity with orientalist flair. Arguably Smith's critique of Lenin and other readers of
	Hegel, that they are unable to meaningfully deal with the religious content of Hegel, applies equally
	to Smith's dealings with non-Hegelian religious practice.
</p>

<h4>3. & 4. Marx and Hegel's breaks and continuities</h4>
<p>
	psych! we'll return here later, because it's the perfect example of what i wanna talk about in the
	next big section.
</p>
<h4>4. & 5. the socialists as Enlightenment truthers</h4>
<blockquote>
	Marx spent his entire working life as a pupil and critic of Hegel. The significance of this dual
	relationship was lost, along with Marx’s humanism, in the Enlightened, scientifically rational
	‘Marxism’ of the Second International. The Third International never recovered it, and in general
	continued the Enlightenment tradition, despite Lenin’s heroic effort to read Hegel’s ‘Science of
	Logic’ in 1914-5.
</blockquote>
<p>
	The above framing of the second international having "gone back" to an earlier step of scientific
	rationalism is incoherent. the rationalist-scientific-antireligious study of society aka sociology
	takes off
	<i>after marx</i> -- <i>because</i> of marx. marx literally sent das kapital to darwin as an
	admirer<SuperScript id="darwin" /> of someone doing work he saw as consistent with his political economic
	theories. he saw himself as
	<i>deeply within</i> a political economic tradition he evolved to <i>encompass</i>
	through critique the earlier ideas of bourgeois commentators.

	full secularism is an 18th-19th century, industrial revolution -accelerated phenomenon. it has
	roots in the reformation and enlightenment, but the tendencies i think smith is naming -- the
	absolute inability to deal with religious content in philosophy and thus the simple refusal to
	acknowledge it as such -- is as i understand it a distinctly post-french-revolution phenomenon,
	not an "enlightenment philosophy" phenomenon hegel was pushing back against and socialists
	returned to. rationalist and/or state socialists did not see themselves as returning to a
	discarded Enlightenment rationalism through Marx. they correctly interpreted marxism as a
	continuation of this legacy, saw themselves as the latest in a long line of modernizers, and
	viewed the formal fulfilment of the legacy as full communism.
</p>

<h3>pt 3: we have never been fucking modern have we</h3>
<p>
	so at this point i want to step back a bit. i'd like to talk about the overall framework Smith is
	using, and why it's this specific framework of marxist, modern humanism that's giving him trouble
	in integrating other cultural traditions and religious experience into the secular marxist
	tradition he's intervening in. i'll take another small section of his piece to work over.
</p>
<blockquote>
	Humans have been trying to understand the world and their own place in it for a long time. This
	has generally taken the form of some kind of religious or mythical account which helped to shape
	the way people lived. This was how they thought about their lives, their origins and their
	destiny. In modern, more ‘enlightened’ times, the attempt is made to explain the world without
	such stories, dismissing them as mere superstition. But that leaves the big question unanswered:
	‘In what kind of world is it possible for conscious humanity to exist?’
</blockquote>
<p>in the above quote we see some clear gestures:</p>
<ol>
	<li>religion is a pan-human experience where cultures "answer" universally posed "questions";</li>
	<li>modernity does not have religious content;</li>
	<li>
		because of this, modernity does not pose answers to the "big" questions (consciousness, why the
		universe exists, etc).
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	I don't know that I really know enough about world religions to know if there are actually
	universalized questions they all ask; I'd be suspicious that even if the same questions crop up,
	the stakes and context for their "answers" or lack thereof might be different enough to require a
	lot of interprative work to make the "questions" appear synonymous. But I'll leave that one alone
	for now, because the idea that modernity has been cleansed of religious content is <i>exactly</i> what
	Latour is arguing against in the book that led me to this article in the first place, and I think Latour's
	argument is exactly the intervention Smith is trying and failing to make.
</p>
<h4>latour time</h4>
<p>
	the title <i>we have never been modern</i> is meant partially ironically, but mostly in earnest:
	so-called modernity sees itself as having made a distinct break from all other ("former") cultures
	in its ability to separate religion from science from the humanities. latour's argument is that
	there has been no such break. i'll just build on myself from a <RainbowLink
		href={`${base}/log/latour1/`}
	>
		log post</RainbowLink
	> from a few days ago to explain his project:
</p>
<p>
	to drastically oversimplify. latour's thesis is that capitalist modernity's chief distinction from
	all other cultures is its inability to unify its theories of the social world, the natural world,
	and text/meaning/semiotics. this inability, and more pointedly the refusal to acknowledge it as
	such, proliferates what latour calls 'hybrids' or 'monsters,' theoretical objects which cannot be
	accounted for neatly under any one paradigm and thus inspire whirlwinds of deflective maneouvers.
	one of latour's examples of such a monster would be pretty much any subject covered in a news
	article:
</p>
<blockquote>
	The same [news] article mixes together chemical reactions and political reactions. A single thread
	links the most esoteric sciences and the most sordid politics, the most distant sky and some
	factory in the Lyon suburbs, dangers on a global scale and the impending local elections or the
	next board meeting. The horizons, the stakes, the time frames, the actors - none of these is
	commensurable, yet there they are, caught up in the same story.
	<br />. . . <br />
	Yet no one seems to find this troubling. Headings like Economy, Politics, Science, Books, Culture,
	Religion and Local Events remain in place as if there were nothing odd going on. The smallest AIDS
	virus takes you from sex to the unconscious, then to Africa, tissue cultures, DNA and San Francisco,
	but the analysts, thinkers, journalists and decision-makers will slice the delicate network traced
	by the virus for you into tidy compartments where you will find only science, only economy, only social
	phenomena, only local news, only sentiment, only sex. . . . By all means, they seem to say, let us
	not mix up knowledge, interest, justice and power. Let us not mix up heaven and earth, the global stage
	and the local scene, the human and the nonhuman. 'But these imbroglios do the mixing,' you'll say,
	'they weave our world together!' 'Act as if they didn't exist,' the analysts reply. They have cut the
	Gordian knot with a well-honed sword. The shaft is broken: on the left, they have put knowledge of
	things; on the right, power and human politics.
	<br />
	(pg 1-3)
</blockquote>
<p>
	in an attempt to deal with these 'monsters' or at least explain their conditions of existence,
	latour embarks upon an anthropology of so-called modernity, or perhaps an anthropology of the
	moderns. latour correctly identifies that the one field in the (post)modern academy where you <i
		>do</i
	> see continuity between nature-culture-text, rather than their neat placement into "tidy compartments,"
	is anthropology:
</p>
<blockquote>
	Once she has been sent into the field, even the most rationalist ethnographer is perfectly capable
	of bringing together in a single monograph the myths, ethnosciences, genealogies, political forms,
	techniques, religions, epics and rites of the people she is studying. Send her off to study the
	Arapesh or the Achuar, the Koreans or the Chinese, and you will get a single narrative that weaves
	together the way people regard the heavens and their ancestors, the way they build houses and the
	way they grow yams or manioc or rice, the way they construct their government and their cosmology.
	In works produced by anthropologists abroad, you will not find a single trait that is not
	simultaneously real, social and narrated.
	<br />
	. . .
	<br />
	It is even <b>because they remain incapable of studying themselves in this way</b> that
	ethnographers are so critical, and so distant, when they go off to the tropics to study others.
	The critical tripartition protects them because it authorizes them to reestablish continuity among
	the communities of the premoderns.
	<b>It is only because they separate at home that ethnographers make so bold as to unify abroad.</b
	>
	<br />
	(pg 7, emphasis mine)
</blockquote>
<p>
	I think we can really see Smith's dilemna here in stark relief. Smith considers himself, and the
	"Enlightenment rationalists" he is covering, to be operating under the assumption that "religion"
	and "politics" and "philosophy" are distinct and separate compartments of human thought. He's able
	to meld these together successfully in a deeply anthropological tone for the Hermitists, because
	they are for him pre-modern. What he does not realize is that "modernity" was in its infancy in
	the Enlightenment; the categories we take for granted now were being worked out in real time, not
	fully formed as Smith seems to assume. And of course, what makes Smith truly "modern" is the his
	inability to study himself in that same anthropological tone -- unable to treat his own "monsters"
	with the disdain and eye for contradictions he brings to all other worldviews. let's return to
	that quote at the head of this section again:
</p>
<blockquote>
	Humans have been trying to understand the world and their own place in it for a long time. This
	has generally taken the form of some kind of religious or mythical account which helped to shape
	the way people lived. This was how they thought about their lives, their origins and their
	destiny. In modern, more ‘enlightened’ times, the attempt is made to explain the world without
	such stories, dismissing them as mere superstition. But that leaves the big question unanswered:
	‘In what kind of world is it possible for conscious humanity to exist?’
</blockquote>
<p>
	smith is unable to <i>even conceive</i> that modernity might have its own origin story! this is
	pretty incredible. on a really obvious level, modern science has the big bang, evolution, the
	modern field of history, and liberal and marxist political economies as foundational 'origin
	stories' for how-things-are. these are stories, <i>narrative</i> stories about how things are and
	were, which have had HUGE repurcussions on "[shaping] the way people lived." regarding the final
	question Smith poses --- science famously loves to throw around theories of cognition, which is
	arguably only <i>the</i> 'big question' under an idiosyncratic and modern-science-inflected paradigm!
</p>
<p>
	the myopia smith shows in this piece is i think largely due to this commitment to modernity as a
	radical break with the past. the pre-modern trappings of superstition are the only christianity
	smith truly percieves as christian and therefore religious; a pan-Abrahamic mysticism which is
	voided of all religious practice or social existence is the only 'religion' capable of providing
	the spiritual basis for modern marxism; if the Enlightenment rationalists were modern, they then
	must have had the 'correct' level of separation between the 'fields' of knowledge; any worldview
	which does not respect the separation of the spheres must be either anthropologized (if consumed
	as external) or subsumed into the extant categories (if consumed as internal).
</p>
<p>as a final note, i'd like to wrap things up by</p>
<h4>returning to the shift in theology between hegel and marx's works</h4>
<p>
	i ended up in the wikipedia page for <i>on the jewish question</i> somewhere in the early stages of
	writing this piece and found a really interesting and helpful piece of context.
</p>
<p>
	from what it seems like on wikipedia, a lot of the engagement with this text is from the angle of
	"was marx antisemitic or was he just being ironic," with all the psychoanalysis that question
	entails. this is a thoroughly uninteresting question to me because the answer is a seemingly
	obvious <b>yes</b> to both questions. delineating where the irony ends and the antisemitism begins,
	or tbh even going over the contents of marx's essay itself, does not interest me here.
</p>
<p>
	the context which interested me has to do with an argument Marx was attempting to refute in OTJQ,
	the argument of his fellow young Hegelian Bruno Bauer.
</p>
<RainbowLink href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Jewish_Question"
	>from wikipedia, emphasis mine:</RainbowLink
>
<blockquote>
	Bauer argued that Jews could achieve political emancipation only by relinquishing their particular
	religious consciousness since political emancipation requires a secular state, which he assumes
	does not leave any "space" for social identities such as religion. According to Bauer, such
	religious demands are incompatible with the idea of the "Rights of Man". True political
	emancipation, for Bauer, requires the abolition of religion.
	<br />. . . <br />
	Bauer states that the renouncing of religion would be especially difficult for Jews. In Bauer's view,
	<b
		>Judaism was a primitive stage in the development of Christianity. Hence, to achieve freedom by
		renouncing religion, Christians would have to surmount only one stage, whereas Jews would need
		to surmount two.</b
	>
	<br />. . .<br />
	Marx uses Bauer's essay as an occasion for his own analysis of liberal rights, arguing that Bauer is
	mistaken in his assumption that in a "secular state" religion will no longer play a prominent role
	in social life, and giving as an example the pervasiveness of religion in the United States, which,
	unlike Prussia, had no state religion.
	<b
		>In Marx's analysis, the "secular state" is not opposed to religion, but rather actually
		presupposes it.</b
	>
	The removal of religious or property qualifications for citizens does not mean the abolition of religion
	or property, but only <b>introduces a way of regarding individuals in abstraction from them.</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
	right okay. so here we get the historical context for the "enlightenment rationalist secularism"
	which marx would have been intimately familiar with and smith is blissfully oblivious to: <b
		>the modern secular state presupposes religion, and anyone who wishes to enter the covenant of
		secular modernity must first accept Christianity.</b
	>
	because judaism and other religions<SuperScript id="religions" /> are understood
	<i>even by a rabid secularist</i> within christian terms, secularism is available only to those who
	understand the world in christian terms first and foremost.
</p>
<p>
	for boyle as well as for smith, in order to recieve the gospel of modernity, you must first accept
	the terms of a universal (christian, european, educated) humanity.

			Trismegistus [the Hermetica] were widely studied as a body of work whose roots are extremely
			ancient. Together with Cabbalah [sic], they had for centuries formed the basis for alchemy,
			astrology and natural magic, but now, and for the next three centuries or more, they were the
			background to the thinking of the leading figures in European thought in the run-up to
			modernity. It was this intellectual world that actually saw the birth of modern science.
		</blockquote>

		i chose the hermetica bc the most famous text included, the "emerald tablet," is the origin of
		the "as above, so below" phrase that gets taken up so strongly by all the contemporary versions
		of christian/christian-flavored western "pagan" occultism i'm familiar with. the category of
		"technical" hermetica is largely a part of those 12th century translations into latin from
		arabic mentioned in the article above.

		<br />
		and he gets it fucking wrong! Like first of all, some of these texts were originally translated in
		the 12th century. Second of all, some of them specifically have never been found in Greek, the plausible
		original language; the earliest copy of the emerald tablet we have is in Arabic and even that wasn't
		recovered until the 19th century, the extant copies were all Latin. Thirdly, the Hermetica's roots
		aren't "extremely ancient," and that's all we'll ever know. They were composed mostly between ~100–300
		CE; the terminology "extremely ancient" is clearly simply trying to appeal to age for mystique rather
		than providing such thing as a boring date range for the text's original creation.
