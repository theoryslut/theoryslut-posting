<h3>30 October 2023</h3>
<h2>
	or, i contemplated writing erotica about this but decided i better express myself in walloftext
</h2>
<h5>CW for sexual violence i guess but all things considered this is p tame</h5>

<p>
	there's this small section of talmud that i have seen discussed as a proof text of judaism's
	liberal-style sex positivity (lol). and also discussed in a <RainbowLink
		href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/162-sex-risk-and-rabbinic-fantasy/id1500147124?i=1000605080582"
		>xai how r u ep</RainbowLink
	> explicitly challenging that shit take by saying, it is simply a joke not really about sex that much
	and also it certainly doesn't ~~model consent~~! it was meant as a tale of what <i>not</i> to do!
</p>
<p>to these people, i say! y'all don't know gay erotica when you see it</p>
<h3>gay erotica when you see it</h3>
<p>bear with me i PROMISE there's enough kink here to make it worth ur time</p>
<p>
	there's this section at the top of berakhot 62a about one rabbi following another to the bathroom
	with the line at the end "it is torah, and i must learn." Classic section

</blockquote>
<p>
	So, we've got here the the skeleton of a joke. One rabbi following another to the bathroom and
	watching him take a shit! Oh no! How scandalous! But then R' Akiva is like nono babe it's chill u
	gotta know how to be modest and wipe correctly. evidently something taught by one's rabbi and not
	one's mother (more on this later)
</p>
<h4>
	repetition for emphasis: <RainbowLink href="https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.62a.2?lang=bi"
		>berakhot 62a:2</RainbowLink
	>
</h4>
<p>
	next we've got repetition with a difference. essentially the same text repeated verbatim, but with
	ben azzai learning from akiva. (click above if u wanna see! it's p verbatim tho)
</p>
<p>
	in context, the repetition conveys quite a bit of meaning. the immediately preceding section in
	berakhot 61b has been discussing various tannaitic rabbi's opinions on taking a shit. should it be
	done facing east-west or north-south? does the direction matter only in eretz yisrael, only where
	you can see the temple, only during a time period when the temple is still standing, or everywhere
	and always (r' akiva's opinion)?
</p>
<p>
	with this repetition, we take a step back from the specific debate and emphasize that bathroom
	practices, too, are handed down as practices rabbi to rabbi, generation to generation. from r'
	yehoshua to r' akiva to r' ben azzai. there's a bit of humor here --- <i
		>you were impertinent to your teacher to that extent?</i
	> --- but we have yet to reach
</p>
<h4>
	the punchline: <RainbowLink href="https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.62a.3?lang=bi"

</h4>
<blockquote>
	<h6>

	<p class="hebrew">
		רַב כָּהֲנָא עָל, גְּנָא תּוּתֵיהּ פּוּרְיֵיהּ דְּרַב. שַׁמְעֵיהּ דְּשָׂח וְשָׂחַק וְעָשָׂה

	<p class="translation">
		On a similar note, the Gemara relates that <b
			>Rav Kahana entered and lay beneath Rav’s bed. He heard</b
		>
		Rav
		<b>chatting and laughing</b>
		with his wife, <b>and seeing to his needs,</b> i.e., having relations with her. Rav Kahana
		<b>said to</b>
		Rav:
		<b>The mouth</b>

		<b>is like</b>
		one whom <b>has never eaten a cooked dish,</b> i.e., his behavior was lustful. Rav
		<b>said to him: Kahana, you are here? Leave, as</b>
		this <b>is an undesirable mode of behavior.</b>
		Rav Kahana <b>said to him: It is Torah, and I must learn.</b>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	So this is a joke, right! That rav kahana is like, not understanding the point because this is
	genuinely unacceptable behavior culturally. But like most punchlines, it condenses a lot; and like
	many jokes, it also sets-through-challenging the bounds of acceptable social behavior. Rav Kahana
	does not get the fucking point, and that's really funny--- but the Rabbis are also clearly setting
	down what is and is not acceptable behavior. Watching your teacher shit: YES. Watching your
	teacher fuck: NO.
</p>
<p>and yet.</p>
<p>and yettttt</p>
<h3>the softcore of antiquity</h3>
<p>
	The setting of one rabbi under another's bed is <i>so</i> evocative. I do think this is intended
	as an instructive tale of how to have sex, actually, and I think the liberal-movement commentary
	I've seen<SuperScript id="mjl" /> completely misses the social stakes it's taking up. This is a story
	about
	<i> gay sex</i>,
	<i>social power</i>, and <i>misogyny!</i>
</p>
<h6>gay sex (or, talmudic tops and bottoms)</h6>
<p>
	First, it makes explicit the erotic subtext of the previous two scenes, that of two rabbis,
	student and teacher, hanging out partially clothed in the bathroom.<SuperScript id="bathroom" /> The
	joke acknowledges the presence of this sexual tension through its diffusion --- sure, they were unclothed,
	alone, in the bathroom, but nothing sexual could have happened, of course! that's definitely beyond
	the pale! except. . . it isn't, because rav kahana literally tries it.
</p>
<p>
	I also want to draw attention to the spacial play. There's a visual pun here: one rabbi under
	another rabbi's bed can be read as a spatial representation of the chain of transmission, one
	generation's insights being subsumed into the next's. but it is also a vertical display, a sexual
	scene: one rabbi, the student, literally underneath the bed of another rabbi, the teacher.<SuperScript
		id="top"
	/> this doubling of the power dynamic, sexual and generational at once, is clearly drawing attention
	to
</p>
<h6>social power (and the chain of transmission)</h6>
<p>
	There are structural parallels in the third section to the motif of generational knowledge
	transmission from the first two. In the first two scenes, we get a display of rabbi-to-rabbi
	knowledge transmission, a reproduction both of knowledge and the method of <i>transmitting</i>
	knowledge from one generation to the next, even at a site of heightened privacy and potential embarrassment.
	L'dor vador: Rabbi to rabbi, generation to generation, toilet to toilet. When discussing the transmission
	of sexual norms, however, the insertion of a woman in the private home becomes both necessary and illuminating
	of uncomfortable truths. Unlike many other traditions and
	<i>mitzvot</i>, reproductive sex is an act of jewish cultural transmission which (supposedly)
	cannot have two rabbis at its center. Reproduction of the family is supposed to happen through
	procreative sex in the private home,<SuperScript id="supposedly" /> the very space religious elites
	historically have very little control over because they have very little
	<i>surveillance</i> over --- a fact that rav kahana's spying plays on.
</p>
<h6>misogyny (or, the parenthetical woman)</h6>
<p>
	The insertion of a woman is quite begrudging. There's a slip in the translation here we have yet
	to discuss: The wife is literally not referred to, not even by pronoun, in the Hebrew. Her
	presence is simply implied by the language of Rav Abba "seeing to his needs," which has seemingly
	historically been assumed to be non-masturbatory and heterosexual activity because these are
	rabbis,<SuperScript id="autofellatio" /> but is not actually explicitly made clear in the text. There's
	a woman here --- has to be a woman here for the joke to be about reproduction/transmission --- but
	she's parenthetical to even the joke at hand, referenced only obliquely through the conversation of
	two rabbis. She acts as the diffuser of the erotic tension evident in the presence of one rabbi underneath
	another's bed; she also acts as the carrier of the continuity of the l'dor vador motif, referencing
	sexual activity as a reproductive and generational act.
</p>
<p>
	and the woman's presence-through-absence in the punchline draws attention to her total absence in
	the first two bits. after all, who teaches one to properly wipe their ass, if not their mother?
	the rabbis here, as talmudists throughout time, are discussing and debating down to the finest
	details of daily life. but they're also intimately aware, and occasionally hint to, how minute
	their influence actually is over, say, how many Jews take their shits facing South.
</p>
<p>
	the historical consensus around the rabbis of the talmud is that they were actually a pretty
	insular crowd talking mostly amongst themselves, and certainly not the mainstream authority of
	their time. the legal rulings in the talmud (when they do rule rather than record a dispute!) are
	generally understood as legal fantasies in a time when Jews were subject to Roman courts under
	Roman rule. to extend this understanding, i think we can see this sugya as fantasizing about a
	level of rabbinic control and insight into daily, intimate, sexual, and women's life that simply
	did not exist at the time.
</p>
<h4>erotica! it's erotica!</h4>
<p>
	this story is a homoerotic sexual fantasy about rabbinic power and its limits. one rabbi sneaks
	under his teacher's bed, watches him fuck, and then compliments him on his sexual prowess. when
	confronted, he slyly gives what is established as a rabbinic catchphrase. and then the story ends,
	leaving the reader entirely to their own devices as to what happens next.
</p>
<p>
	even if you take my theory of this being softcore aside, which you should not because i am right,
	there is an explicit engagement here with social power and its reproduction. leaving that
	commentary on social power out by, say, interpreting this as "judaism is pro watching your rabbi
	fuck," or "this is about how desperate rav kahana was to learn about proper modesty"<SuperScript
		id="cmon"
	/> or heAven forbid "it's just a joke don't think about it that hard" is i think simply rude to the
	rabbis. who clearly knew Exactly what shit they were about
</p>
<h3>wait what about that fanfic tho</h3>
<p>
	Anyway I think it would be hot to write fanfic of the wife in this scenario where rav kahana
	convinces rav abba to teach him about sex through his wife who he never actually refers to as an
	extant person with agency and a sexuality. Like imagine being halfway through getting head from ur
	man and suddenly his hot 22yr old student pops out and is like "wow, great job man, u got any
	pointers on this" and then they slowly fuck you and each other without once acknowledging you as
	an active participant because in their eyes you're not? Fucking hot. I'm TBH much more interested
	in the wife's experience than the rabbis' lol, so i don't think i'd write it as slash. It's such a
	potent little scene that would offer a really good opportunity to explore what it's like to be at
	the center of the image of sex but barred from its experience (aka, a woman). And also it's simply
	hotter to write from the perspective of the person getting raped
</p>
<h3>bonus</h3>
<p>
	this section of talmud and my takes thereupon are as canonical to me as the letter from engels<SuperScript
		id="ofc"
	/> to marx discussing being ass-raped by the queer vanguard of the future, which me obrien seemingly
	dug up from the abyss purely for my entertainment. below, from
	<a href="https://endnotes.org.uk/articles/to-abolish-the-family.pdf">to abolish the family</a>,
	which you should go read in its entirety:
</p>
<blockquote class="parentblock">
	The homophobia of Marx and Engels also showed a certain ambiguity. In an 1869 letter, Engels
	writes to Marx concerning a book by homo- sexual militant Karl Ulrich:
	<blockquote>
		These are extremely unnatural revelations. The pederasts are beginning to count themselves, and
		discover that they are a power in the state… they cannot fail to triumph. Guerre aux cons, paix
		aus trous-de-cul will now be the slogan. It is a bit of luck that we, personally, are too old to
		have to fear that, when this party wins, we shall have to pay physical tribute to the victors.…
		Then things will go badly enough for poor frontside people like us, with our childish penchant
		for females.
	</blockquote>
	The contempt is clear, but also their own ironic play at lagging behind the coming queer revolution,
	contem- plating the neglect of their own behinds.
</blockquote>
<p>
	it's. so fucking funny. frontside people. . . imagining themselves too old to be cruised. . . the
	reversal of the psychoanalytic positioning of queer people as immature in favor of a marxist
	conceptualization of sodomites as the class successors of heterosexuals (YEARS before
	psychoanalysis even exists! queer vanguardism, queers as a class, as concepts predate the invert
	and the homosexual! y'all!). . .
