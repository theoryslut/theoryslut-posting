<h1>revisiting the rectum & its grave</h1>
<h2>9 August 2023</h2>
<p>
	in a study group for jewish liturgy i'm attending rn, we were translating the asher yatzar
	word-for-word. it was a great discussion; among other things, we were talking about the relation
	of the words נְקָבִים and חֲלוּלִים (n'kavim and chalulim) to their literal meaning of bodily
	orifices/bowels; their gestural meaning of pipes/channels/perforations/openings/holes; and then
	the root and verb-form meanings relating to desecration, breaking vows, profaning, blaspheming,
	etc. we were talking about how this makes sense intuitively in terms of the relation to the
	bowels, but also that the connection directly from openings/liminal spaces to desecration makes a
	lot of sense-- like, openings to something external from something internal as a (the?) potential
	channel to both sacredness and profanity. and i, oBvIoUsLy couldn't resist the temptation to bring
	up is the rectum a grave? and then afterwards reread it in full as i seem to do every few years.
</p>
<p>
	lots of thoughts. much of it doesn't age well, much of it simply speaks to an earlier time, much
	of it is actually really incredible. it has in particular a rather thin understanding of social
	violence as something which seems to paradigmatically happen to "blacks" and "jews," the
	blueprints for all other violences for bersani, in a very 1980s white theorist sorta way that is
	nonetheless an embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
	but a rather shocking take of bersani's seems to kind of be arguing that femininity is not
	sexualized in a gay context, only macho shit is? which is a truly stunning take. in a bathhouse
	context this makes sense to me. but like, trans women are famously Around in this period in urban
	gay scenes, hypersexualized, and not as distinct from Gay Male Identity as compared to today
	(partially as a result <i>of</i> AIDS era shifts in policy and politics). so it's rather stunning to
	see the complete and seemingly oblivious elision in a piece talking about uh, the resemblence of "gay
	male" sexuality to "female sexuality." like! sir!
</p>
<p>a quote from later on in the piece, to show you what i mean:</p>
<blockquote>
	[blah blah blah] the infinitely more seductive and intolerable image of a grown man, legs high in
	the air, unable to refuse the suicidal ecstasy of being a woman
</blockquote>
<p>
	like. sir. some people don't even <i>try</i> to refuse that suicidal ecstasy, and that image is
	famously at the root of several major genres of pornography <i>because</i> of its intolerableness.
	which bersani does Not seem to clock--- his reference is narrowly to masc4masc gay male scenes.
</p>
<p>
	this quote on queer desire is rather evergreen however, and feels incredibly familiar when
	interpreted in a trans context i think:
</p>
<blockquote>
	The dead seriousness of the gay commitment to machismo (by which I of course don't mean that all
	gays share, or share unambivalently, this commitment) means that gay men run the risk of
	idealizing and feeling inferior to certain representations of masculinity on the basis of which
	they are in fact judged and condemned. <b
		>The logic of homosexual desire includes the potential for a loving identification with the gay
		man's enemies</b
	>
</blockquote>
<p>
	to skip an analogy to "blacks and jews"' respective subject formation processes that i don't think
	quite holds up, he goes on to say
</p>
<blockquote>
	[I]nternalization is in part constitutive of male homosexual desire, which, like all sexual
	desire, combines and confuses impulses to appropriate and to identify with the object of desire.
	An authentic gay male political identity therefore implies a struggle not only against definitions
	of maleness and of homosexuality as they are reiterated and imposed in a heterosexist social dis-
	course, but also against those very same definitions so seductively and so faithfully reflected by
	those (in large part culturally invented and elaborated) male bodies that we carry within us as
	permanently renewable sources of excitement. <br />. . . <br />If, as Weeks puts it, gay men "gnaw
	at the roots of a male heterosexual identity," it is not because of the parodistic distance that
	they take from that identity, but rather because, from within their nearly mad identification with
	it, they never cease to feel the appeal of its being violated
</blockquote>

<p>EVERGREEN statements on queer/trans subject formation.</p>
<blockquote>
	The pastoralizing project could be thought of as informing even the most oppressive demonstrations
	of power. If, for example, we assume that the oppression of women disguises a fearful male
	response to the seductiveness of an image of sexual powerlessness, then the most brutal machismo
	is really part of a domesticating, even sanitizing project. The ambition of performing sex as only
	power is a salvational project, one designed to preserve us from a nightmare of ontological
	obscenity, from the prospect of a breakdown of the human itself in sexual intensities, from a kind
	of selfless communication with "lower" orders of being.
	<br />. . . <br />
	But what if we said, for example, not that it is wrong to think of so-called passive sex as "demeaning,"
	but rather that the value of sexuality itself is to demean the seriousness of eflorts to redeem it?
	<br />. . . <br />
	<b
		>The self is a practical convenience; promoted to the status of an ethical ideal, it is a
		sanction for violence.</b
	>
</blockquote>
<p>evergreen, i say!</p>
<p>and of course, couldn't neglect to shout out the perfect one-liner:</p>
<blockquote>
	Women and gay men spread their legs with an unquenchable appetite for destruction.
</blockquote>
<p>
	if i hadn't transitioned over an atla slashfic this line would have done it at some point or
	another. criticisms aside, i am eternally in debt to the generations of gay sluts who have decided
	to write about the thing. their insights, even when radically opposed to my own understandings,
	are such a window into how much of my understanding of sex is <i>not</i> something i arrived at ahistorically
	and is rather a product of long, embarrassing debates about sex and desire that happened relatively
	recently.
